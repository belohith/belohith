As a result of the work experiences I had, I am someone who's skilled at both creative side as well as technical side. Hence I see that as an asset.

I've written and published a fictional book called 'Waiting in Bangalore' which you can buy on Amazon Kindle.

I do designing. From Illustrations, Logos, UI/UX of your website or app, magazine edits to anything related to design. So if you or your business needs a designer, text me.

I do video editing and videography. I started doing short films when I was in college for my interest in films. As a result, I got to learn a few things in that field. I've made short films, edited podcast videos, made promo videos for businesses, edited vlogs and also worked as an intern for few companies and clients. So if you need a guy for that, text me.

I develop too. I loved Coding when I discovered it's true potential during my college days. I feel, a lot of problems can be solved by programming them into applications and currently I'm doing the same. I'm working on an app called Caramel which is a social app. It's currently in beta testing phase and will be released soon. You can fill the form on my website and join the beta testing group.

Also on that note, here's a website that I made for myself from scratch. It's basic, since I didn't want to spend time on designing for now. Soon after I finish atleast a major portion of doing all my projects that I wanted to do, I'll be updating it soon.

Also, I'm working on a project which is a portal of apps for different platforms. Check it out! It is updated regularly.
